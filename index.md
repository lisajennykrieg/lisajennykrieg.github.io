I'm an anthropologist and author of speculative fiction interested in human-technology-environment relations - in particular in the messiness around the blurred boundaries between the categories. 

I'm currently conducting research in the DFG-funded project "Gecko Translocalities", which explores the realtionships between humans and Phelsuma day geckos in the terraristics and herpetology community in Germany, and with nature conservationists on La RÃ©union and Mauritius. 

After stations in [Utrecht][utrechtanthro], [Amsterdam][chem], and [Bonn][geobonn], I'm currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the research group of [Prof. Julia Verne][verne] at the Geography Department of the University of Mainz.

My research has been published in various international journals. My fiction has appeared at [deutsche-science-fiction.de][dsf], and in [Exodus Magazin][exo]. One short story has been translated into Marathi and published in the literary journal <strong>Kelyane Bhashantar</strong> (Marathi translation quarterly). 

My all-time favorite authors are [Tonke Dragt][tonke], [Nnedi Okorafor][nnedi], [David Mitchell][david], and [Dan Simmons][dan].
