I'm an anthropologist located in Bonn, Germany. I'm interested in digital anthropology and human-technology-animal-environment relations, and currently conduct fieldwork with the
terraristics and herpetology community in Germany, and with nature conservationists on
La RÃ©union and Mauritius. When I do not teach or write, I can be found playing pony with my
 daughter, bouldering, or reading a book by my favorite authors [Nnedi Okorafor][nnedi], [David Mitchell][david], or [Dan Simmons][dan].

Since October 2016, I'm part of the research group of [Prof. Julia Verne][verne] at the [Department of Geography][geobonn]
of the University of Bonn.
In October 2016, I defended my PhD thesis on social memory in Germany at the [Anthropology Department][utrechtanthro] at Utrecht University.
Between 2015 and 2016, I've been working as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Chemical Youth][chem] 
project at the [Anthropology Department][uvaanthro] of the University of Amsterdam with [Prof. Anita Hardon][anita].
